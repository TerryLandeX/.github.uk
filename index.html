<p>Ethiopia is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa. It has the continent’s second highest population at 109,358,444 and its surface area of 1,100,000 sq. km. is the tenth largest. Addis Ababa is the capital and the country is bordered by Sudan to the west, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south, and Eritrea to the north.</p>

<p>When the European powers divided the African continent at the Berlin Conference, Ethiopia was one of two countries that retained its independence. It was one of four African members of the League of Nations. It became a member of the United Nations after a brief period of Italian occupation. Several newly independent African nations took Ethiopia’s colors for their flags. Addis Ababa was the center of several international groups focused on Africa.</p>

            <p>Ethiopia is more than four times the size of the UK, and with roads in various stages of construction and repair, full day drives are not uncommon. This is compounded by the fact that driving should always take place in daylight; wild animals plus unlit donkey carts and locals herding livestock mean that accidents are all too likely after dusk. But these long drives really allow you to appreciate the changes in scenery.

            <p>Since its establishment in the 19th century, Addis Ababa (አዲስ አበባ) has always seemed like a magical portal, a gateway to another world. For the rural masses of Ethiopia it was, and is, a city whose streets are paved in gold; for a foreign visitor, the gateway of Addis Ababa is at the verge of an ancient and mystical world. And yet, Addis – Africa’s fourth-largest city and its diplomatic capital – is also a sprawling city that many foreign visitors try to transit as quickly as possible.

            <p>Ethiopia is the home of the earliest human kind that was proved by the oldest human ancestors ever found remains were in Ethiopia.

            The first upright walking human kind, Lucy was discovered in maze of ravines in northeastern part of Ethiopia, Afar State in 1974 by Anthropologist Professor Donald Johansson and his student Tom Gray.

            She was twenty years old and over one meter long. Lucy is known for her first specious of Homo Afaranesis (Homo specious named after Lucy), which believed has lived for over three million years before.</p>

<h2>Ethiopian`s Blue Nile Dam</h2>



<p><img style="width:370px;height:280px;float:left" src="img/damm.jpg">Ethiopia has started to generate electricity from what is set to be Africa’s largest dam on the Blue Nile — an icon of national pride that has been at the centre of a regional dispute since work first began more than a decade ago.

“Today&thinsp;the GERD’s first turbine began generating power,” prime minister Abiy Ahmed tweeted on Sunday from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. “This is good news for our continent and the downstream countries with whom we aspire to work together. As Ethiopia marks the birth of a new era, I congratulate all Ethiopians!"

Ethiopia’s self-financed — with dam bonds and contributions from civil servants’ salaries — $4.2bn project will generate more than 5,000MW of electricity by its planned completion date of 2024, helping extend power to many of the 65mn Ethiopians who still live without electricity, officials say.</p>

<p>Yet Egypt and Sudan, the downstream neighbours of Ethiopia, a country of 115m people, view it as a threat because of their dependence on water from the Nile. Ethiopia, the source of the Blue Nile, known locally as Abay, counters that it has the right to use the river for its own development. It argues the GERD will cause no damage to its downstream neighbours, and that it could even benefit Sudan.</p>
